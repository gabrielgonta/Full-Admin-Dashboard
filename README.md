# ðŸ§©   Full Admin Dashboard

## Description

Welcome to Full Admin Dashboard! ðŸŽ‰

This is a production-ready, fully responsive admin dashboard built using React, Tailwind CSS, and Shadcn UI. It includes key features such as a Kanban board, data tables, interactive charts, calendar, real-time chat, and modules for user and product management. Designed with scalability and developer experience in mind, this project is an excellent foundation for any modern web admin interface.

        ðŸ’¡ Future Plans: This project is currently frontend-only, but I plan to evolve it into a fullstack application with real backend integration (authentication, data persistence, etc.).
